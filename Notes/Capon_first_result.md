# getCapon vs. USTB's capon_minimum_variance.m
By applying the same parameters in both Capon implementations, we get the
result shown below

</p>

The getCapon result is temporarily in a squared format, due to problems with
USTB.

Through a quick visual check using the USTB "movie" feature (vet ikke hva
dette burde kalles), it is possible to notice that the results are visually
the same. In this format (located [here](https://github.uio.no/helenewo/MasterThesis/blob/main/Figure/CaponResult1.mp4)), the amplitude
also corresponds. However, this is not the case for the two separate results
shown above. This may be a result of USTB working its magic.....
